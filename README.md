# Python Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python.

## Description

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food and growing in size. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or its own body.

This implementation of the game is written in Python and uses the Pygame library for graphics and user input.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run the `snake.py` file with Python. The game board will appear, and the snake will start moving automatically.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without hitting the wall or the snake's own body.

If you collide with your own body, the game ends and your score is displayed. You can restart the game by pressing r or exit with r + escape.

## Installation

To run this game, you will need to have Python, Keyboard, and Pygame installed on your computer. You can install Pygame using pip:

```
pip install pygame
pip install keyboard
```


Once you have Pygame installed, simply clone or download the repository and run the `main.py` file with Python.
